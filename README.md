Hi ðŸ‘‹! Iâ€™m Chris and I am a full stack developer with interests in blockchain technology and decentralized finance. Iâ€™ve been involved in a bunch of different opensourced projects and startups, you can check them out below.

I see blockchain as a technology that empowers people for the first time to challenge the power structures that define our society at a protocol level.

Oh and I also like scuba diving, photography, live music and good food ðŸ¤˜ðŸš€.
